Given a monocular video sequence, our proposed FlashAvatar can reconstruct a high-fidelity digital avatar in minutes which can be animated and rendered over 300FPS at the resolution of 512Ã—512 with an Nvidia RTX 3090.

## Setup

This code has been tested on Nvidia RTX 3090. 

Create the environment:

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate FlashAvatar
```

Install PyTorch3D:

```
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge fvcore iopath
conda install -c bottler nvidiacub
conda install pytorch3d -c pytorch3d
```
